          Hello! My name is Christopher Offiong, and I have created 
          this website to tell you a little about myself. I'm currently 
          27  years old and I am now enrolled in a coding bootcamp 
          at  Georgia Tech. I am fasctinated with the 
          idea of learning everything there is about not only 
          front end, but back end web development that is 
          being offered there. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Through the use of this course I feel as though I can better myself 
          not only in the tech field, but also as a person! I hope that I can share 
          experiences with  my teachers,TAs and classmate on this journey that we all 
          have taken part of!
        </p>
        <p>This is the second revision of this portfolio page. I will continue to grow it out as 
          I learn more languages. This newest revision has made the page more mobile friendly! Feel
          free to visit this site on your phone or tablet and see the great mobile responsiveness!
