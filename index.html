         Hello! My name is Christopher Offiong, and I have created 
        this website to tell you a little about myself. I'm currently 
        27  years old and I am now enrolled in a coding bootcamp 
        at  Georgia Tech. I am fasctinated with the 
        idea of learning everything there is about not only 
        front end, but back end web development that is 
        being offered there. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Through the use of this course I feel as though I can better myself 
        not only in the tech field, but also as a person! I hope that I can share 
        experiences with  my teachers,TAs and classmate on this journey that we all 
        have taken part of!
